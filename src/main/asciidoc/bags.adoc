[[bags_search]]
=== Search for Bags

There are really two different ways to search the database, and this function is
used to do either (or both) of them.  If a string is provided in the `text` field,
it will search for any bag that has any of the listed `fields` containing that
text.  If any `filter` objects are provided, the results will then be filtered to
only including matching bags.

Because these results could include a lot of data, there are also multiple ways
to filter how much is returned.  Search results will be divided up into pages
that include at most `limit` number of bags at a time, and the `page` parameter
will return the nth page in the search result set, starting with 1.  The
`fillTypes` and `fillTopics` parameters can also be used to control whether
message type and topic information is included in the results, which can
significantly increase the size of the output returned.

===== Request Params

The `filter` param is generated programmatically by the web interface, but here's
what each object looks like.

===== ExtJsFilter Fields

|The value to compare against; this should be either a number or a string,
depending on the column.

[[bags_get]]
=== Get a Bag

If you know the database ID of a bag file, use this to get all the
information about it from the database.

[[bags_download]]
=== Download a Bag File

This can be used to download either an entire bag file or just part of one from
the bag database.  This call allows CORS and support the HTTP Range header, so
it is suitable for streaming bag data to other web applications.

[[bags_get_image]]
=== Get an Image from a Bag

This retrieves an HTML document containing an img element that has the
requested image embedded.  This method is used by the Bag Database to render
images in the web interface; note that whatever the encoding was in the bag
file, it will be converted into a JPEG here.

[[bags_get_gpscoords]]
=== Get a Sequence of GPS Coordinates for a List of Bags

If you want to get a list of coordinates you could use to draw a route on
a map, this will get all of the coordinates for a list of bag files and
concatenate them together.

==== Example Request
include::{snippets}/bags/get-gps-coords-for-bag/http-request.adoc[]

===== Request Params

[[bags_get_tags]]
=== Get Tags for a Bag

==== Example Request

[[bags_remove_tags]]
=== Remove Tags for a Bag

==== Example Response

[[bags_set_tag]]
=== Set Tag for a Bag

This sets a tag for an existing bag.  Note that tag names are unique; if there
is an existing tag with this name, it will be overwritten.

[[bags_set_tags]]
=== Set Tag for multiple Bags

Just like above, except this tags multiple bags at once.

[[update_bag]]
=== Update a Bag's Metadata

This updates a bag's metadata in the database.  Note that although this method
expects to be provided a full Bag object in the request, most of these fields
are not mutable because they are inherent properties of the bag file.

To use this method, first obtain a Bag object using <<bags_get>>, then modify
the fields you want to update.

The only fields this method can modify are:

- `description`
- `latitudeDeg`
- `longitudeDeg`
- `location`
- `vehicle`
- `tags` (* New tags will be added, but missing tags will not be removed)

[[bags_get_storage_ids]]
=== Get Storage Ids

Retrieves a list of every storage backend's unique identifier.  This is useful for
specifying where you want to upload a bag with <<bags_upload>>.

==== Example Request
include::{snippets}/bags/get-bag-storage-ids/http-request.adoc[]

==== Example Response
include::{snippets}/bags/get-bag-storage-ids/response-body.adoc[]

[[bags_upload]]
=== Upload a New Bag

This method exists primarily so the web interface can upload new bag files.  For
your own purposes, it may be easier to use another protocol such as SFTP to
directly upload new bags to the database's filesystem.

You can control which storage backend receives the uploaded file by setting
the `storageId` parameter to a value received from <<bags_get_storage_ids>>.  If the
`storageId` is not specified, it will be assumed to be `default`, which is appropriate
if you are using the default filesystem-based storage.
